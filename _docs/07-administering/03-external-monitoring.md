You can use third party monitoring tools to monitor the deployed {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} Kafka cluster by connecting to the JMX port on the Kafka brokers and reading Kafka metrics.

If you have a tool or service you want to use to monitor the health of your clusters, you can [raise a request](../../support/#suggest-a-feature).
